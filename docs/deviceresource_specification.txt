DeviceResource Specification (Attributes)

The DeviceResources of BACnet each contains four attributes: type, instance,
property, and index.

The type attribute is the object type and is an enum. The number of
the different object types can be found in bacenum.h of the BACnet stack
(http://bacnet.sourceforge.net/). The object types also supports the Analog
Input, Analog Output, Analog Value, Binary Input, Binary Output, Binary Value
and Device written as strings analogInput, analogOutput, etc. The rest
of the object types needs to be given the enum corresponding to the type.

The instance attribute is the object intance which is a number.

The property attribute is the property to be read. This is an enum contained in
bacenum.h of the BACnet stack (http://bacnet.sourceforge.net/). The property
also supports Present Value and Object Name written as strings presentValue and
objectName. The rest of the properties needs to be given the enum corresponding
to the property. If no property attribute is given, the property defaults to
Present Value.

The index attribute is the array index of the property. If no index
attribute is given, the index defaults to none.

An example of the attributes of a deviceResource in YAML can be seen here:

attributes:
            { type: "analogInput", instance: "4", property: "presentValue", index: "none" }
