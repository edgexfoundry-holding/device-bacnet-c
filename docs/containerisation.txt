Containerisation of the BACnet device service.

The BACnet device service can be build in a docker container. A Docker file is
provided in the scripts/ directory using Alpine Linux 3.16 as the base image. To build an
image using this Docker file, change directory to the base directory of the
device service and execute the following command:

$ docker build --no-cache --tag bacnet-device-service --file ./scripts/Dockerfile.alpine .

This will build the device service image containing both the BACnet/IP and
BACnet/MSTP device services.

Having built the docker image, a docker container can now be run. To run the
BACnet/IP device service execute the following command:

$ docker run --name bacnet-device-service --network=edgex_foundry_edgex-network -p 59980:59980 bacnet-device-service

The docker run command specifies the port to expose from the container. This
should be the same as in the configuration file. The standard for the 
BACnet device service is 59980

When running the BACnet/IP device service in a container, it will need to
communicate to a BBMD device to be able to contact devices that are not located on
the edgex_foundry_edgex-network. The BBMD device can be specified in the
configuration in the res/ directory.

To run the BACnet/MSTP device service the alternative entry point must be
specified, and the MSTP device path to be made available to the container. To do this,
the --entrypoint and --device parameters need to be set for the docker run command.
An example of this can be seen in the following command:

docker run --name bacnet-device-service --network=edgex_foundry_edgex-network -p 59980:59980 --entrypoint /device-bacnet-mstp/device-bacnet-c --device=/dev/ttyUSB0 bacnet-device-service

The device specified in the "--device" argument should be the same as set up in
the Driver section of the configuration file located in the res/ directory.
