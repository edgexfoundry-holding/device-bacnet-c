Operation with Simulator (bacserv)

The BACnet device service can be tested with the BACnet server simulator
(bacserv) application from the BACnet Protocol Stack
(http://bacnet.sourceforge.net/).

BACnet IP:
To test the BACnet IP device service with bacserv, set up a virtual machine
with an IP on the same subnet as the BACnet IP device service. The reason to
run the BACnet server on a virtual machine is to give it a different IP, as
BACnet IP requires each device to have its own IP or a BACnet router to know
how to relay the messages to the right devices. Download
version 0.8.6 of the BACnet stack
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/bacnet/files/bacnet-stack/bacnet-stack-0.8.6/)
and save it on the virtual machine. Follow the readme.txt to build the BACnet
stack including the demo applications, and follow the help instructions of the
bacserv application in the demo/server directory to run the server.

When the bacserv application is running, start the device service on your local
machine and add the BACnet server to EdgeX manually, or use the discovery API
call to automatically discover the device. The name of the Profile for
automatic discovery should be "SimpleServer". The demo/server directory
contains a PICS file describing all the object available for reading and
writing to the server. One of these is the Present Value of Analog Output 0
with no index. The value will be 0 when you start the service, but a PUT
request can change the value, and a GET request allows the value to be read.
A profile enabling access to two of the objects in bacserv is supplied in the
profiles directory.

BACnet MSTP:
To test the BACnet MSTP device service with bacserv, the same machine can be
used for running both the server and the device service, but virtual serial
ports must be set up, which can be done using the command line tool
"socat". These are the steps to be taken:

Download the BACnet stack version 0.8.6
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/bacnet/files/bacnet-stack/bacnet-stack-0.8.6/)
Go to the downloaded BACnet stack: cd <bacnet-stack-0.8.6>
Compile the BACnet stack for MSTP: make BACDL_DEFINE=-DBACDL_MSTP=1 clean all
Setup virtual serial ports on machine: socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0,
pty,raw,echo=0
Open a new terminal and go to the bacnet-stack server demo folder: cd
<bacnet-stack-0.8.5/demo/server>
Set environment variable for BACNET_MAX_MASTER connections: e.g. export
BACNET_MAX_MASTER=1
Set environment variable for BACNET_MSTP_MAC to a low and unique MAC in the
BACnet network: e.g. export BACNET_MSTP_MAC=1
Set environment variable specifying the device path of one of the virtual
serial connections: e.g. export BACNET_IFACE=/dev/pts/2
Start the BACnet server with device instance 1234: ./bacserv 1234
Set environment variable for BACNET_MAX_MASTER connections for the device
service: e.g. export BACNET_MAX_MASTER=1
Set environment variable for BACNET_MSTP_MAC to a low and unique MAC in the
BACnet network for the device service: e.g. export BACNET_MSTP_MAC=0
Set environment device path of the unused virtual serial connection in the TOML
configuration: e.g. /dev/pts/3

When the device service is running, the BACnet server can be added to EdgeX
manually, or use the discovery API call to automatically discover the
device. The name of the Profile for automatic discovery should be
"SimpleServer". The demo/server directory contains a PICS file describing all
the object available for reading and writing to the server. One of these is the
Present Value of Analog Output 0 with no index. The value will be 0 when you
start the service, but a PUT request can change the value, and a GET request
allows the value to be read.
A profile enabling access to two of the objects in bacserv is supplied in the
profiles directory.

Setting BACNET_MAX_MASTER and BACNET_MSTP_MAC is generally not necessary for
the BACnet MSTP device service to function with physical devices, but not
setting them for virtual devices has been known to cause communication issues.
