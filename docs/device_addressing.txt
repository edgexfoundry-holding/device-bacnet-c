Device Addressing (Protocol Properties)

BACnet IP:
BACnet IP needs to be provisioned using the device instance or IP of the
device being addressed, as well as the port of the device. To the protocols
section of a device being added to EdgeX add an entry called BACnet-IP, with
two entries called DeviceInstance and Port. DeviceInstance is the device
instance of the device, for instance 53, or the IP address of the device. Port
is the port of the device, for instance 47808. The following is an example of
the protocols of a BACnet IP device in JSON.

"protocols":{
     "BACnet-IP":{
         "DeviceInstance": "53",
         "Port":"47808"
     }
}

BACnet MSTP:
BACnet MSTP needs to be provisioned using the device instance and device path
of the device being addressed. To the protocols section of a device being added
to EdgeX add an entry called BACnet-MSTP, with two entries called
DeviceInstance and Path. DeviceInstance is the device instance of the device,
for instance 53. Path is the device path of the MSTP device, for instance
/dev/ttyUSB0, which is used to know if the device is connected to the device
path that the device service is using. The following is an example of the
protocols of a BACnet MSTP device in JSON.

"protocols":{
     "BACnet-MSTP":{
         "DeviceInstance": "53",
         "Path":"/dev/ttyUSB0"
     }
}
